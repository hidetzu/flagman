# Rules

⚠ **This directory holds "how to write it".**
⚠ **"How to work" is [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md), "what may be claimed" is
[`docs/SPEC.md`](../../docs/SPEC.md), and "why" is [`docs/adr/`](../../docs/adr/).**

⚠ **Never duplicate.** ⚠ **Written in two places, one of them goes stale.**
⚠ **If a subject already has an owner, this directory only says "look there".**

## Two kinds of rule, and they are not interchangeable

```text
Engineering constraint          Learned pitfall

⚠ **Everything in this directory is an engineering constraint.** ⚠ **It binds now.**
⚠ **It does not wait for an accident here to earn its place.**
⚠ **Each section states its grounds** — cite those, never an anecdote.

⚠ **Never demote a constraint to "we will see" because nothing has gone wrong yet.**
⚠ **Never promote one into `CLAUDE.md` §9 by inventing an incident.**

⚠ **A learned pitfall can add a rule here.** ⚠ **When it does, the grounds it cites is the
incident, and `CLAUDE.md` §9 keeps the row.**
⚠ **The two records point at each other; neither replaces the other.**

## What is here

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`evidence.md`](evidence.md) | ⚠ **What may be said to have been observed.** Denominators, counts, outcomes |
| [`verification.md`](verification.md) | The three tiers, partial runs, `PASS` / `FAIL` / `NOT-VERIFIED`, ⚠ **and that an exercise must not change the world** |
| [`owner-decisions.md`](owner-decisions.md) | Decide yourself vs. ask, `ready-for-ai` |
| [`git.md`](git.md) | Commits, permission, forbidden operations, what never goes public |

> ⚠ **FILL IN.** Add this project's own files and list them above. Typically:
> the language (responsibility, memory, errors, naming), the layer split, the domain,
> and anything whose rules an outsider could not guess.
> ⚠ **Name the grounds in each.** ⚠ **A rule with no grounds gets argued away.**

⚠ **`MUST` = required, `SHOULD` = default, `MAY` = optional.**
⚠ **`⚠` marks "it hurts if you step on it"** (same convention as `CLAUDE.md`).

## ⚠ Subjects owned elsewhere

⚠ **Do not copy these here.**

| Subject | Owner |
|---|---|
| not observed ≠ did not happen / never dress a guess as a measurement / denominators | [`evidence.md`](evidence.md) |
| Wording a human reads (never open with what does not work) | `CLAUDE.md` §4 |
| Which checks to run, in what order | `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` (⚠ **each project writes its own**) |
| How to review a change (scope, rules, stale results) | `.claude/skills/change-review/SKILL.md` |
| Whether an issue can be handed over | `.claude/skills/issue-ready/SKILL.md` |
| Making an owner decision answerable by looking | [`visual-decision`](../skills/visual-decision/SKILL.md) |
